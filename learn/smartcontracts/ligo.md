# LIGO

[LIGO](https://ligolang.org) is a programming language for Tezos with support for different syntaxes:

* JsLIGO, a JavaScript inspired syntax
* CameLIGO, an OCaml inspired syntax
* ReasonLIGO, a ReasonML inspired syntax that builds on the strong points of OCaml. It aims to be familiar to those coming from JavaScript.
* PascaLIGO, a Pascal inspired syntax

These syntaxes are transformed into an intermediate representation, which is type checked and efficiently translated into Michelson.
